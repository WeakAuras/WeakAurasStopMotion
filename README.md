# WeakAuras Stop Motion

This addon adds a new region type to WeakAuras that allows for stop motion animations. Stop Motion textures contain each frame of the animation as a separate image. The addon ships with a number of animations and it supports custom textures.

It is most useful for advanced WeakAuras users that want to graphically spice up their UI.
